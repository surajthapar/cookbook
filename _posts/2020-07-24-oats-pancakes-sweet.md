5. Keep the batter for 5 mins till formation of bubbles is observed. 
6. Meanwhile take a large pan adding castor sugar to it keeping the flame low. Keep it for a minute and add in 1 cup of water followed by cinnamon stick and black cardamom. 
7. Keeping the flame as medium high and just when the water starts to boil , add in the chopped apples and cover with a lid keeping the flame as low for about 10 mins or till the apples absorb the water. 
8. Turn off the flame and let this cool down. 
9. Pour some oil/butter/ghee on a hot pan/griddle (the pan shouldnâ€™t be too hot) 
10. Pour in the batter using a 1/4th cup and spread it with the help of a spoon. 
11. Let it rest on low flame till you see tiny holes being formed on the pancake. 
12. Flip it gently so that both the sides are cooked.
